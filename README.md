# CSE_4618_ArtificialIntelligence

In this repository, I outline the course lab carried out for the Artificial Intelligence CSE 4617 course along with the lab CSE 4618, conducted by Bakhtiyar Hasan Sir

Note: We did not have to implement all of the code but rather portions of the code as outlined by the taskbook in the resources section

Some of the solutions may be missing, in that case please look into [This Repository](https://github.com/rsk2327/CS188x_1-Artificial-Intelligence-Berkeley.git), thanks to the author of this repository for a more refined work
